# Lyynix' More Journal Enrichers
This is a module for FoundryVTT.\
FoundryVTTs text editor natively supports the enricher `@UUID`, which is extended by enrichers like `@Scene`, `@Actor`, ...\
All of those have the same functionality: *Click to open/edit*

With More Journal Enrichers you can use similar commands to show game elements in a more usable way. 

A list of all added enrichers can be found under [Usage & Features](#usage--features).

## Installation
You can simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup.\
Or you can paste the manifest URL in said window:\
!! Paste manifest URL of recent release !!

## Usage & Features
To use any of the enrichers, write or paste the enricher into the text editor of FoundryVTT and fill in the missing elements.

Every enricher in the following list has a link to the corresponding wiki page, where its functionality and possible restrictions are explained.
